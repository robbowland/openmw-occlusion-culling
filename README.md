Aggressive Performance
======

Experimental optimizations for OpenMW that reduce CPU-side bottlenecks. Works best in dense cities like Narsis and Old Ebonheart.

## Software Occlusion Culling (Intel Masked Occlusion Culling)

Terrain and building meshes are rasterized into a low-resolution CPU depth buffer during cull traversal. Objects whose screen-space AABB is fully behind the depth buffer are rejected before reaching the draw thread, saving draw calls for hidden geometry.

## No culling, No in cell paging:

## In Cell Paging (already in OpenMW, you just have to turn it on):

occlusion culling statics = true
occlusion buffer width = 512
occlusion buffer height = 256
occlusion terrain lod = 3

Debugging settings:
```ini
[Camera]
occlusion debug overlay = true
occlusion culling interiors = true
occlusion debug messages = true
```


### Known Issues

- **Shadow casters culled too early** — If a building is occluded but would normally cast a visible shadow, that shadow disappears. Rarely noticeable in practice. Workarounds: disable shadows, use soft shadows, or use higher resolution shadows.

## Shadow Temporal Reuse

Skips shadow cascade cull traversals on non-update frames while reusing the previous shadow map FBO textures. Only the shadow-space matrices are recomputed each frame so shadows track the moving camera.

**Setting:** `[Shadows] shadow update interval` (default `1` = off, max `4`)

```
interval=1 (off):
  Frame 1: [main cull][shadow cull x3][CLSB] → draw
  Frame 2: [main cull][shadow cull x3][CLSB] → draw

interval=2:
  Frame 1: [main cull][shadow cull x3][CLSB] → draw   ← full update
  Frame 2: [main cull]                       → draw   ← reuse FBOs

interval=3:
  Frame 1: [main cull][shadow cull x3][CLSB] → draw   ← full update
  Frame 2: [main cull]                       → draw   ← reuse
  Frame 3: [main cull]                       → draw   ← reuse

interval=4:
  Frame 1: [main cull][shadow cull x3][CLSB] → draw   ← full update
  Frame 2: [main cull]                       → draw   ← reuse
  Frame 3: [main cull]                       → draw   ← reuse
  Frame 4: [main cull]                       → draw   ← reuse
```

### Recommended Settings

```ini
[Shadows]
shadow update interval = 2
```

### Known Issues

- **FPS jitter** — Average FPS increases but alternates between update and reuse frames (e.g. 60-70 instead of a steady 40-45). Use a framerate cap if this is distracting.
- **Lagging NPC shadows** — At interval 2 this is negligible. At interval 4, NPC shadows visibly trail their owners. Use 4 only with NPC shadows disabled — it works well for terrain and statics, whose shadows only shift with time-of-day.
- **Shadow glitches** — Occasional brief visual artifacts on shadows during reuse frames.

---

The two systems are independent: occlusion culling saves draw calls by rejecting hidden objects, shadow reuse saves CPU cull traversals by skipping shadow cascade walks.

### Additional Performance Settings

```ini
[Terrain]
distant terrain = true
object paging = true
object paging active grid = true
```

OpenMW
======

OpenMW is an open-source open-world RPG game engine that supports playing Morrowind by Bethesda Softworks. You need to own the game for OpenMW to play Morrowind.

OpenMW also comes with OpenMW-CS, a replacement for Bethesda's Construction Set.

Current Status
--------------

The main quests in Morrowind, Tribunal and Bloodmoon are all completable. Some issues with side quests are to be expected (but rare). Check the [bug tracker](https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/?milestone_title=openmw-1.0) for a list of issues we need to resolve before the "1.0" release. Even before the "1.0" release, however, OpenMW boasts some new [features](https://wiki.openmw.org/index.php?title=Features), such as improved graphics and user interfaces.

Pre-existing modifications created for the original Morrowind engine can be hit-and-miss. The OpenMW script compiler performs more thorough error-checking than Morrowind does, meaning that a mod created for Morrowind may not necessarily run in OpenMW. Some mods also rely on quirky behaviour or engine bugs in order to work. We are considering such compatibility issues on a case-by-case basis - in some cases adding a workaround to OpenMW may be feasible, in other cases fixing the mod will be the only option. If you know of any mods that work or don't work, feel free to add them to the [Mod status](https://wiki.openmw.org/index.php?title=Mod_status) wiki page.

The data path
-------------

The data path tells OpenMW where to find your Morrowind files. If you run the launcher, OpenMW should be able to pick up the location of these files on its own, if both Morrowind and OpenMW are installed properly (installing Morrowind under WINE is considered a proper install).
